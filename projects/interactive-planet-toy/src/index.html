<!-- Interactive Planet Toy - Stefan Weck

Launch new planets by clicking and dragging. You can see the predicted path of your new planet to see if it will collide with any other planets. Once a smaller planet hits a bigger planet it will disappear. Planets of the same size can't hit each other. 

Every planet will apply a gravitational pull on other smaller planets. The bigger the planet, the stronger the gravitational forces!

Tip: You can turn on pauseWhileAiming in the dat.gui window to pause the simulation, this allows you to do some very specific planet launching. Have fun! -->
