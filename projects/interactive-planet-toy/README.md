A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/stefanweck/pen/ggGzyv](https://codepen.io/stefanweck/pen/ggGzyv).

Launch new planets by clicking and dragging. You can see the predicted path of your new planet to see if it will collide with any other planets. Once a smaller planet hits a bigger planet it will disappear. Planets of the same size can't hit each other. 

Every planet will apply a gravitational pull on other planets. The bigger the planet, the stronger the gravitational forces!
