**BACKSTORY**

Three days ago, I learned my classmate **Pritha** is shifting to a new college. We used to fight and argue a lot but, at the end of the day, we were good friends. We enjoyed hanging out with each other.

Today is her birthday, so I baked her a few **pastries with CSS**. Yes, you can have some üòã

Maybe we will still be connected through social media, or maybe not. No matter where we are, I will always appreciate the love and support she has given me since the beginning.

All the best for your new journey, **Pritha**! ‚ú®

**ARTWORK REFERENCES**

It has been very challenging to pull this off after long sessions in college. This artwork was inspired by several other designs on the web. I have linked those in [**this Google Collection**](https://www.google.com/collections/s/list/P1q_bMDFTG2pf2ErSJkUXw/cjdOFc29Cfo).

**BROWSER COMPATIBILITY**

I have tested this CodePen demo on several browsers, including **Chrome for Android 4.4.2**. Though it had some scaling issues in Huawei devices, it should work fine in **Chrome v81** and higher.
